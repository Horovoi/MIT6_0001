# MIT6.0001 — Introduction To Computer Science And Programming In Python

These are my solutions to coding problem sets at the MIT's course [*6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

The course consists of 6 problem sets. Each folder contains the problem set description and my solutions.

## List of topics covered in problem sets:
- Problem Set 0 — Introduction to Python.
- Problem Set 1 — Annuity Calculator: basic functions, for loops, while loops, conditionals, bisection search.
- Problem Set 2 — Hangman Game: manipulating strings, lists, tuples and dictionaries, loops, conditionals.
- Problem Set 3 — Word Game: functions, dictionaries, advanced loops and conditionals.
- Problem Set 4 — Caesar Cipher: OOP, classes, inheritance, attributes, methods, recursion, unit testing.
- Problem Set 5 — RSS Feed Reader: web scraping, regular expressions, classes, subclasses, inheritance, obeject polymorphism.
